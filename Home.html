<h1>Galle Fort Sri Lanka</h1>
<img src="Image3.JPG"  width="400px" height="280px">
<p>The Galle Fort is fortified with its beautiful architecture, the breathtaking natural surrounding and its rich heritage. Looking down from the Fort, one could see the cerulean waters lazily lapping the shore and if you are lucky you could witness the crimson sun dipping into the Indian Ocean in the evenings. The Portuguese had built this Fort but after the Dutch took over the rule of Ceylon the Dutch had extensively fortified it.</p>
